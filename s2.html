1.What is JVM?<br>

The Java interpreter along with the runtime environment required to run the Java application in called as Java virtual machine(JVM)<br><br>

 


2. What is the most important feature of Java?<br>

Java is a platform independent language.<br><br>

 


3. What do you mean by platform independence?<br>

Platform independence means that we can write and compile the java code in one platform (eg Windows) and can execute the class in any other supported platform eg (Linux,Solaris,etc).<br><br>

 


4. What is the difference between a JDK and a JVM?<br>

JDK is Java Development Kit which is for development purpose and it includes execution environment also. But JVM is purely a run time environment and hence you will not be able to compile your source files using a JVM.

 
<br><br>

5. What is the base class of all classes?<br>

java.lang.Object<br><br>

 


6. What are the access modifiers in Java?<br>

There are 3 access modifiers. Public, protected and private, and the default one if no identifier is specified is called friendly, but programmer cannot specify the friendly identifier explicitly.

<br><br>


7. What is are packages?<br>

A package is a collection of related classes and interfaces providing access protection and namespace management.

<br><br>


8. What is meant by Inheritance and what are its advantages?<br>

 Inheritance is the process of inheriting all the features from a class. The advantages of inheritance are reusability of code and accessibility of variables and methods of the super class by subclasses.
 <br><br>
 


9. What is the difference between superclass and subclass?<br>

 A super class is a class that is inherited whereas sub class is a class that does the inheriting.
 <br><br>
 


10. What is an abstract class?<br>

An abstract class is a class designed with implementation gaps for subclasses to fill in and is deliberately incomplete.
   <br><br>  11.List the different storage class specifiers in C?<br>

     Answer: static, auto, extern, register<br><br>
     12. How can we replace the following statement by using WHILE Loop?<br>

     for (x=1; x<=100; x++)<br>
     printf ("%d ", x *x );<br>
     
     
     Answer:<br>
     x=1;<br>
     while (x<=100)<br>
     
     {<br>
     printf ("%d ", x * x);<br>
     x++;<br>
     }<br><br>
    13. Differentiate between the = symbol and == symbol?<br>

Answer: The = symbol is<br><br>

14. For what purpose we use a ‘ character?<br>

<<br><br>
15.Name the different functions are used for dynamic memory allocation in C Program?<br>

Answer:
malloc(),calloc(),realloc(),free()<br><br>
16.Can the curly brackets { }be used to enclose a single line of code?<br>

Answer: While curly brackets are main<br><br>
17. How can we generate random number<br>

Answer: Random numbers are generated in C using the rand() command. For example: anyNum = rand() will generate any integer number beginning from 0, assuming that anyNum is a variable of type integer.<br>
<br>
18. Explain about spaghetti programming?<br>

Answer: Spaghetti programming refers to programs that tend to get tangled and overlapped throughout the codes. This unorganized approach to coding is usually attributed to lack of experience on the part of the programmer. Spaghetti coding makes a program complex and analysing the codes difficult, and so must be avoided as much as possible.<br><br>
19.Some Programmers debug their programs by placing comment symbols on some of the codes instead of deleting it. How does this aid in debugging?<br>

Answer: Using comment symbols “/* */ ” in  a code, also called as commenting out, is a way of segregate some codes that you think maybe causing errors in the code, without deleting the program. The aim is that if the code is in fact correct, we can simply remove the comment symbols and continue on. It also saves you time and effort on having to retype the codes if you have deleted it in the first place.
<br><br>
20. What is call by value and call by reference in C Programming language?<br>

We can pass value to function by two different ways: call by value and call by reference. In case of call by value, a copy of value is passed to the function, so original value is not modified in the call by value. But in case of call by reference, an address of value is passed to the function, so original value is modified in the call by reference.<br><br>
